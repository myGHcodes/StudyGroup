    // it has to be no return type

    // What is Contructor?
    // Constructor it is a block of code(method signature). That initialize the variables.
    // doesn't have a return type
    // name of the Constructor has to be SAME as class name
    // Constructor is called automatically when new object is created
    // java compiler provides default constructor(empty constructor)
